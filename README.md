# Random Codes Repository

This repository contains a collection of random codes and projects that I want to experiment with. The topics may range from Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to Machine Learning and beyond.

## Contents
- DSA problems and solutions
- Machine learning experiments
- Miscellaneous coding exercises

Feel free to explore the code and use anything you find helpful!
